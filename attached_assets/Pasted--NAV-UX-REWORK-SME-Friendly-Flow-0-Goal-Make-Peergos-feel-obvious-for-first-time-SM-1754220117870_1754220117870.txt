♻️  NAV + UX REWORK  —  “SME-Friendly Flow”

### 0. Goal
Make Peergos feel obvious for first-time SME users:
* Flat, 1-layer nav (Dashboard / Bookkeeping / Taxes / Reports / AI / Settings)
* Context cards & quick-actions
* Bottom tab-bar on mobile
* Consistent progress pills across filings
* Remove gray “coming soon” links (replace with a single Roadmap page)

---

### 1. Flatten & rename navigation
1. Delete `SidebarItem` entries for
   * “Accounting”, “Tax Compliance”, sub-menus, “Bank Feeds”, “Invoice Scan”, etc.
2. Add six items in **this order**:
Dashboard | Bookkeeping | Taxes | Reports | AI | Settings
3. Route map:
* `/`               → Dashboard
* `/bookkeeping`    → new consolidated page (see §2)
* `/taxes`          → new consolidated page (see §3)
* `/reports`        → Financial Reports
* `/ai`             → AI Tax Assistant
* `/settings`       → existing Administration panel
* `/roadmap`        → placeholder page listing Bank Feeds, Invoice Scan, UAE Pass SSO, FTA API, e-invoice signature

---

### 2. Bookkeeping page (tabs)
Create `Bookkeeping.tsx` with ShadCN `Tabs`:
[ Revenue | Expenses | Invoices ]
* Move existing Revenue & Expenses components here.
* **Invoices**: embed invoice builder list.
* Remove old “Invoicing” nav entry.

---

### 3. Taxes page (tabs)
`Taxes.tsx` tabs:
[ VAT Return | CIT Return | Transfer Pricing ]
* Render existing VAT & CIT pages inside tabs.
* Transfer Pricing tab shows current stub with “Phase 2” banner.

---

### 4. Dashboard polish
1. After wizard completes, redirect to **Dashboard** and show card:
   > 🎉 Setup complete — next, record your first expense  
   > **[Add Expense]**
2. Add four `QuickActionButton`s top-right:
   * Add Expense
   * File VAT
   * File CIT
   * Ask AI
3. Display “Last filed” date on VAT & CIT metric cards.

---

### 5. Global “Ask AI” button
* Floating `Button` (`fixed bottom-6 right-6 md:hidden`) opens AI slide-over.

---

### 6. Consistent progress pills
* Create `<ProgressPill step total>` component.
* Place on VAT Return, CIT Return, Invoice Builder (Step 1 of 2: Draft → Submit).

---

### 7. Mobile bottom tab-bar
Show when `window.innerWidth <= 767`:
🏠 📒 📑 📊 🤖
Icons → same routes as sidebar.

---

### 8. UX micro-wins
* Add “Skip tour” link in wizard header.
* `useEffect(() => firstEmptyInputRef.current?.focus(), [])` on all forms.
* After successful VAT/CIT filing, `navigate('/reports?show=latest')`.
* Expense form: set `autoFocus` on description.

---

### 9. Roadmap page
`ComingSoonPage.tsx` lists:
* Bank / POS Feeds (Q4 2025)
* Invoice Scan & OCR (Q4 2025)
* UAE Pass SSO (Q1 2026)
* FTA Live API (Q1 2026)
* E-invoice Signature (Q2 2026)

Link “See what’s next” under sidebar.

---

### 10. Tests
* **Playwright** `nav-flow.spec.ts`  
  1. login → complete wizard → lands on Dashboard card  
  2. click QuickAction “Add Expense” → opens `/bookkeeping?tab=expenses`
* Mobile viewport 375×812: bottom tab-bar visible, sidebar hidden.

---

### 11. Commit & push
```bash
git add client/src/components/nav/**/* client/src/pages/{Bookkeeping,Taxes,ComingSoonPage}.tsx
git add client/src/components/ProgressPill.tsx
