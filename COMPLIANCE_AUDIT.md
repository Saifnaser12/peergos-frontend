## üìã CONCLUSION

The current Peergos implementation successfully delivers the core tax compliance functionality outlined in the PDF, with robust CIT/VAT workflows, FTA integration, and SME-focused features. The primary gaps are in external system integrations and mobile accessibility, which represent the next phase of development for full market readiness.
